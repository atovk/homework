## 题目描述
Given an absolute path for a file (Unix-style), simplify it.

For example,
path = "/home/", => "/home"
path = "/a/./b/../../c/", => "/c"

click to show corner cases.

Corner Cases:
```
- Did you consider the case where path = "/../"?
In this case, you should return "/".
- Another corner case is the path might contain multiple slashes '/' together, such as "/home//foo/".
In this case, you should ignore redundant slashes and return "/home/foo".
```
